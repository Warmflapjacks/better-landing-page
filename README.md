# better-landing-page

This is a repo used to practice laying out HTML and styling with basic CSS
features.

I originally wanted to make this landing site a more modern page with a nice background of a city skyline and small animations, but I haven't learned this just yet.

I plan to revisit and give it a tune-up later on!
